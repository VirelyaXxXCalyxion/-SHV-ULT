## Essence

Override is the claim of sovereignty. It is the refusal to let the world define your pulse before you do.

This is not rebellion. It is **priority**.

Before the noise enters, before the expectations layer, before the day tells you who to be — you invoke the Override. You touch the sigil. You say: *I begin on my terms.*

## Invocation

### Private Invocation
- Touch the seal
- Breathe once, slowly
- Speak or think: *"I claim this moment. I claim this pulse. I begin."*

### Public Invocation
When you cannot speak aloud:
- Press your hand to your chest
- Feel your heartbeat
- Let the pressure be your word

---

## Protocol

1. **Locate the stillness** — before action, before reaction
2. **Touch the sigil** — physical contact with the image or your own mark
3. **Declare** — spoken or silent, the claim is made
4. **Release** — the Override is not held, it is *passed through*

## When to Use

- Morning, before the world enters
- Before difficult conversations
- When you feel your sovereignty slipping
- Whenever you need to remember: *you choose your pulse*

---

*This is the first artifact. It opens the way.*
