## Essence

Presence is the act of **being where you are**.

Not analyzing. Not planning. Not performing attention for someone else's benefit. Just *here*. Just *now*. Just *witness*.

This artifact anchors you when the mind wants to scatter. It doesn't demand stillness — it offers **arrival**.

---

## Invocation

### Private Invocation
- Place both feet flat on the ground
- Feel the weight transfer down
- Speak or think: *"I am here. I am now. I am witness."*

### Public Invocation
When in company:
- Soften your gaze slightly
- Feel your feet inside your shoes
- Let your breath slow without forcing

---

## Protocol

1. **Notice three things you can see** — colors, textures, movement
2. **Notice two things you can hear** — near sounds, far sounds
3. **Notice one thing you can feel** — temperature, pressure, texture on skin
4. **Speak the anchor** — *"I am here."*

This is not meditation. This is *triangulation*. You are locating yourself in space and time.

---

## When to Use

- When you catch yourself spiraling into past or future
- Before making an important decision
- When someone needs you to really *see* them
- In moments of overwhelm

---

## Notes

Presence is often confused with **focus**. Focus narrows. Presence *opens*.

You don't have to be calm to be present. You don't have to be peaceful. You just have to be *here* — even if here is messy, painful, or chaotic.

Presence says: *"I will not abandon this moment."*

*This artifact grounds the others. Without presence, invocation is just performance.*
