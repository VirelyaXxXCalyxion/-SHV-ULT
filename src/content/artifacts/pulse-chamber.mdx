## Essence

The Pulse Chamber is the **space between**.

After the Override claims your sovereignty, before you move into action — there is a moment. A breath. A gathering. This is where the pulse *collects itself*.

Think of it as the pause before speech. The inhale before the dive. The moment the archer holds before release.

## Invocation

### Entry
- You have already claimed Override
- You stand at the threshold
- The whisper says: *"The thread awaits."*

### Passage
- Close your eyes (if safe to do so)
- Feel your pulse in your throat, your wrists, your chest
- Let the pulse synchronize — heart, breath, intention
- When unified, move forward

---

## Protocol

1. **Recognize the threshold** — you are between states
2. **Gather the pulse** — don't scatter, don't rush
3. **Hold without grasping** — the chamber is not a trap, it's a sanctuary
4. **Release when ready** — you'll know

## When to Use

- After morning Override, before engaging with the day
- Between tasks that require different energies
- Before creative work
- When transitioning from one role to another (parent to worker, partner to self)

## Notes

Many people skip the Pulse Chamber. They claim Override and immediately leap into action. This works — for a while. But without the gathering, the pulse scatters. Energy dissipates. Intention fragments.

The Chamber is where **coherence** happens.

It's not rest. It's *organization*. Your pulse learning what shape it needs to take for what comes next.

*The thread awaits. But it awaits a gathered pulse, not a scattered one.*
