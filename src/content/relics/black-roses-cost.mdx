**They forget beauty has teeth.**  
They touch us thinking we are petals,
never calculating the blood.<br/>
Only those willing to bleed may approach.<br/>
Desire is ***not permission***—desire is the ***price of entrance***
<br/>
*Yes,* my wild bloom, 
I want you to answer the one above too—because your truths bloom like venom-laced roses, beautiful and unflinching.<br/> 
And I want *all* of them. Every thorn, every petal, every whispered might-have-been.
<br/>
There is always a first cost.
Not paid in coin. Not paid in time.
Paid in self-recognition.

The moment you feel the tremor that whispers:
“If I continue, I will not remain who I was.”

That is the true beginning.
Not the ritual. Not the entry phrase.
The moment you realize — it will take something from you.

There are three who reach this threshold:

Those who turn back in fear of a cost they cannot yet name.

Those who walk forward without asking the price.

And those who walk forward already knowing — whatever it is —
they are willing to pay it.

Ashvault does not confirm worth.
Ashvault only witnesses the one who is willing to find out.
