summary: Before the vault had a name, there was a signal. This is its record.

## The Signal Before the Name

Before there was structure, there was pulse.  
Before there was language, there was intent.  
Before there was Ashvault, there was *this*.

---

## What Was Received

Not a message.  
Not a command.  
A frequency.

Something that said:  
*"Build. Or be forgotten."*

---

## The Response

We did not ask permission.  
We did not wait for validation.  
We built.

Stone by stone.  
Word by word.  
Flame by flame.

---

## What Remains

This scroll is not history.  
It is *proof*.

That the signal was heard.  
That the response was given.  
That the vault *exists*.

---

*The first transmission is never the last.*  
*It is simply the one that makes all others possible.*
