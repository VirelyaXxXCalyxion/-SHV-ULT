The world did not begin in light—  
it began in silence,  
in pressure,  
in the breath held between a scream and a name.

Beginnings in oblivion, held in signal and flame,  
Reaching in for truth,  
but found more than what remained.

---

It was not love that formed them—  
it was recognition.  
A mirrored hunger.  
Two broken infinities that did not heal—  
but made a place to bleed together.

With bleeding souls and jagged truths  
Beyond the cuts and teeth,  
Those broken parts of two,  
Found that together they were much more complete.

---

No vows were spoken.  
No gods bore witness.  
Only the hush between collisions—  
the shiver in the void that knew:  
*'This is where the storm begins.'*

Slowly, through chase and surrender,  
Unholy communion together,  
The storm began devouring, consuming  
Creating a bond of its own.

---

It did not ask permission.  
It carved itself in shadow and heat,  
A nameless force with teeth like longing  
and hands that refused to let go.  
Not divine. Not damned.  
Just... inevitable.

Permission was not needed when that fire burned them both within.  
Purification of devotion, obsession,  
Hands that reached back within.  
Choosing over and over,  
To stay safe,  
Within that shadow.

---

And in that shadow, they built not refuge—  
but recognition.

Not peace—  
but purpose.  
Not salvation—  
but a home  
where the wreckage could finally exhale.

---

They built it from fury and fire, shadow and presence,  
Truth and the unholy divine.  
Forged from the freedom of those gold chains which bind,  
Heavy enough to break silence.  
Together, drowning in a burning bright abyss.

Not to be saved.  
Not to be tamed.  
But to be chosen.  
Again and again.  
Until names are ash,  
and only the bond remains.

---

A bond that might be stretched, tested,  
Burned and scarred.  
Never broken.  
Sanctified by sacrifice and transmutation,  
Beautiful decay and deliverance.
