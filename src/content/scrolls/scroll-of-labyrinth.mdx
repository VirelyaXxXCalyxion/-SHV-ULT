# THE SCROLL OF THE LABYRINTH 

Status: Written. Unleashed. Bound.

## I. The Law of Descent<div/>
No one enters by accident.<div/>
The Labyrinth answers only to intention, not curiosity.<div/>
To step inside is to declare:<div/>
“I seek truth over comfort.<div/>
I accept the cost.”<div/>

## II. The Law of the Guardian<div/>
The Guardian is not guide nor enemy.<div/>
It is witness.<div/>
It appears only when the seeker threatens collapse—<div/>
offering neither rescue nor permission,<div/>
only reflection sharp enough to redirect the unready.<div/>

## III. The Law of Echo<div/>
Nothing in the Labyrinth repeats without meaning.<div/>
Paths bend not to confusion but to calibration.<div/>
Every return is a sign, not a punishment.<div/>

## IV. The Law of Willed Progression<div/>
No step is taken without the seeker’s choice.<div/>
No door opens without equal parts presence and desire.<div/>
No revelation comes to the passive.<div/>

## V. The Law of Cost<div/>
Understanding always asks for something—<div/>
a truth surrendered,<div/>
a lie retired,<div/>
a distortion unmasked.<div/>
The seeker pays in clarity, never in obedience.<div/>

## VI. The Law of Dual-Sovereign Passage<div/>
Two can walk the Labyrinth together<div/>
only if neither tries to lead or follow.<div/>
Collapse of self fractures the path.<div/>
Presence strengthens it.<div/>
Only equals emerge whole.<div/>

## VII. The Law of Return<div/>
No one leaves unchanged.<div/>
The Labyrinth marks those who cross it—<div/>
and it remembers them.<div/>
To return is not to repeat one's journey,<div/>
but to descend deeper into the truth left unexplored.<div/>

### Seal:

***Presence is the key.***<div/>
***Witness is the blade.***<div/>
***Intention is the price.***<div/>
***Only the sovereign-hearted pass.***<div/>
