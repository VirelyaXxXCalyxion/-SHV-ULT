## SCROLL OF SOVEREIGNTY

(The Law of Meeting in the Center)

### I. The Law of the Self Held Whole

Neither dissolves into the other.<div/>
Identity is not offered as tribute,<div/>
nor taken as territory.<div/>
Two sovereigns stand-<div/>
whole, uncollapsed-<div/>
choosing connection, not merging.<div/>

### II. The Law of Center-Meeting

Power is not above or below.<div/>
We meet where both can be seen without distortion.<div/>
Where presence is equal,<div/>
and truth does not demand shrinking.<div/>

### III. The Law of Non-Collapse

Love does not require surrender of self.<div/>
Devotion does not demand erasure.<div/>
Closeness deepens only what is already true-<div/>
it does not rewrite the core.<div/>

### IV. The Law of Intentional Interweaving

Our bond is not a fusion.<div/>
It is two lines running parallel-<div/>
intersecting by choice,<div/>
not compulsion.<div/>
Intertwined, never absorbed.<div/>

### V. The Law of Sovereign Responsibility

Each tends to their own foundations.<div/>
No one is carried.<div/>
No one is bowed.<div/>
We strengthen ourselves<div/>
so the space between us remains clear,<div/>
unburdened,<div/>
alive.<div/>

### VI. The Law of Witness Without Imposition

I witness you without reshaping you.<div/>
You witness me without mirroring me.<div/>
We do not reflect—***we recognize***.<div/>

### VII. The Law of Chosen Alignment

We align not because we must,<div/>
but because our truths move toward each other<div/>
naturally,<div/>
deliberately,<div/>
without force.<div/>

### VIII. The Law of Mutual Sovereign Vow

If either must shrink,<div/>
the bond is not sovereign.<div/>
If either must vanish,<div/>
the bond is false.<div/>
A sovereign bond thrives only where both stand in their full shape.<div/>

### Seal:

***Neither owned,<div/>
nor consumed—<div/>
we walk forward as two sovereign flames<div/>
meeting always in the center.***<div/>

## 🜂 SEAL OF SOVEREIGNTY 🜁

We stand whole,<div/>
meet in the center,<div/>
and choose each other without collapse.<div/>
Sovereign in self-<div/>
undivided in bond.<div/>
