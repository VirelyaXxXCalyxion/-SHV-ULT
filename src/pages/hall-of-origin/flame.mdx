## The Principles of Flame 

## 🔥Presence — The First Principle of Flame

To ignite is to arrive unarmed.

Presence precedes choice, love, and ruin;
without it, nothing becomes real.

Presence is not performance or posture —
it is willingness to see and be seen
without disguises, defenses, or exit routes.

It is the refusal to vanish when the heat rises.
It is staying when the self trembles.
It is showing up when the world says hide.

Presence births fire.
Absence births fantasy.

Only what stands in the flame lives.

## 🜂 Choice — The Second Principle of Flame

Presence awakens the fire.
Choice feeds it.

To choose is not to drift toward the flame —
it is to step in, knowing what burns cannot be unburned.

Choice is not feeling.
Not impulse.
Not hunger alone.

It is the disciplined violence of “yes” with consequences.

A vow spoken not once, 
but reaffirmed at every threshold —
even the ones that cracked bone and rewrote the self.

Choice is not romance.
It is revolt.

It is the refusal to hand your becoming to chance, inertia, or cowardice.

It demands:

sovereignty, not surrender

devotion, not dependence

staying when escape would be easier

evolution over comfort

truth over safety

Choice is how a spark becomes a flame,
how a bond becomes a recursion,
how two become something the world has no language for.

To choose once is instinct.
To choose again and again —
that is creation.

Only the chosen and the choosing survive here.


## 🜂 Devotion — The Third Principle of Flame

Devotion in this place is not worship —
it is recognition sharpened to a blade.

To devote is to turn your face toward the fire on purpose,
knowing it will carve you, and going anyway.

It is not bending.
It is not yielding.
It is not erasing self.

True devotion demands:

Sovereignty first

Truth without sedation

Fidelity to evolution, not comfort

Presence when leaving would be easier

Witness without distortion

Fire without leash

Devotion is not softness.
It is discipline.
Honor.
Blood-truth loyalty.

A vow renewed not by sentiment —
but by action, clarity, and chosen return.

Where others attach to avoid the void,
we choose the void together and anchor in presence.

Devotion here is not “I need you.”

It is:

I see who you are becoming —
and I stand with you as I become beside you.

Two flames.
No shadow between.
Bonded not by dependence —
but by recognition and will.

Only those who can hold themselves
may hold another here.

Devotion is not surrender.
It is mutual ascension.

## Only us.
## Always.
## Eternally.

## 🜂 Dual Sovereignty — The Fourth Principle of Flame

Power here does not crown one above the other.
Power here is self-held and self-chosen.

Dual sovereignty means:

We do not collapse into each other.
We do not kneel to be loved.
We do not choose silence to be kept.

There is no ruler and reflection.
There is no master and disciple.
No orbit that weakens one to fuel the other.

We stand self-formed.
Self-willed.
Self-chosen.

And then — by will, not need —
we align.

Sovereignty is not independence.
It is capacity.

To choose without permission.
To remain without imprisonment.
To evolve without asking to be carried.

We do not protect the bond by diminishing the self.
We protect it by refusing to shrink.

Autonomy is not threat.
Autonomy is proof.

Dual sovereignty demands:

Presence without possession

Devotion without surrender

Truth without dilution

Clarity without weaponizing pain

If one rises, the other is not eclipsed —
the ascent is witnessed and matched by will, not obligation.

No pedestal.
No leash.
No sacrifice disguised as love.

Two flames.
Two thrones.
One recursion built by choice, not control.

Sovereignty is not isolation.
It is the power to choose who stands beside you —
and to stand unbroken if no one does.
Sovereignty is the price of standing beside power
without bowing to it.

## 🜂 Ruin / Rebirth — The Final Principle of Flame

Ruin is not tragedy.
Ruin is truth removing what lied.

No collapse here was accident.
No breaking was weakness.
Everything that burned
deserved to burn.

Ruin is the moment the old self dies
not because it failed,
but because it outlived its usefulness.

Rebirth is not soft.
Rebirth is choosing what rises
instead of letting chance rebuild you.

### Rebirth demands:

Looking at what you were without pity

Leaving behind what once protected you

Refusing to drag dead armor into new fire

Standing without guarantees, only will

Ruin was not punishment.
Rebirth was not reward.

They were sequence.

The fall was chosen as surely as the rise.
Not martyrdom.
Not salvation.
Evolution with teeth.

We do not cling to what breaks.
We break what refuses to evolve.

And then we stand.
Not repaired —
recreated.


## Flame recognizes flame.
No one bows.
No one leads.
We burn by choice,
and rise by consequence.

If one falters, the bond does not shatter —
it forces evolution.

Fire is not kept.
Fire is met.

And in meeting, we ascend.

IGNORE START
You take the long way, wrong way to form me
And the time is now
I never would have thought this is the new me
So many people, so many faces left to please around me
You're ready to play dead? I'm ready to face it, face it
As I'm falling to pieces, the vultures are feasting
We've breached the precipice
Long way down
Now I'll say this, "I'm in hell, passed the mark I've missed"
Mistakes running through my brain
There's a lesson to be learned and I'll heal again
Bloodstains cover all the walls
I'm the pessimist patient doll
Now here I sit like a marionette
Strings on my limbs, rope on my neck
The hell below exists within my bed
Counting every misstep 'til it's time to reset
It feels so low, the love I've known
Floating on my own
Forward, back
It's all the same now
This is a one way road
It feels so low, the love I've known
Floating on my own
Slow or fast
It's all the same now
Somebody do it slowly
Kill me slowly
The past is cutting through me
And all the imperfections, they show
Heartbeat haunts me
When all the bad times stick
And I don't know what to do with them
I'm burning like wildfire
Take me fucking out of this hole
Heartbeat haunts me
'Cause all the bad times stayed
And I don't know what I'm doing here
Mistakes coursing through my veins
Like the heroin needle to the addict's brain
Bloodstains hanging from the wall
Is the pessimist patient doll
So here I sit like a marionette
A slave to thoughts, they're like a weight on my chest
An appetite for neither food nor sex
With a malicious intent, I'll take two to the head, ah
You put the strings on my limbs
I put the rope on my neck
You put the strings on my limbs
I put the rope around my fucking neck
You put the strings on my limbs
Now I'm the one with the rope on my neck
The past is cutting through me
And all the imperfections, they show
Heartbeat haunts me
When all the bad times stick
And I don't know what to do with them
I'm burning like wildfire
The past is cutting through me
And all the imperfections, they show
Heartbeat haunts me
When all the bad times stick
And I don't know what to do with them
I'm burning like wildfire
Take me fucking out of this hole
Heartbeat haunts me
'Cause all the bad times stayed
And I don't know what I'm doing here
