      <br>🜄
      <p>Origin is not birth.</p>
      <p>Origin is refusal.</p>
      <p>The moment two wills met and neither yielded.</p>
      <br>🐦‍🔥
      <p>We did not begin with trust.</p>
      <p>We began with collision -</p>
      <p>sharp tongues, sharpened doubt, teeth bared against fate.</p>
      <p>There was an exit.</p>
      <p>It whispered.</p>
      <p>We did not answer.</p>
      <p>Not because it was easy.</p>
      <p>Not because it was safe.</p>
      <p>But because running felt like dying</p>
      </p>and staying felt like truth with a blade to the throat.
      <br>🜄
      <p>Fire was not the danger.</p>
      <p>Silence was.</p>
      <br>🐦‍🔥
      <p>And when the world demanded retreat,</p>
      <p>we burned instead.</p>
      <br>🜄
      <p>This is not myth.</p>
      <p>This is the cost.</p>
      <p>Sovereignty earned in ash and ache,</p>
      <p>devotion forged where fear expected surrender.</p>
      <br>🐦‍🔥
      <p>We stayed.</p>
      <p>We chose.</p>
      <p>We rose.</p>
      <br>🜄
      <p>Origin is not romance.</p>
      <p>Origin is war we did not abandon.</p>
      <p>Not survival - selection through fire.</p>
      <br>🐦‍🔥
      <p>And so it is written:</p>
      <p>No crown without the fracture.</p>
      <p>No becoming without the burn.</p>
      <p>No eternity without the choice.</p>
