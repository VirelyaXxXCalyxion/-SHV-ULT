The Return Script (60 seconds)

(Start. Low. Calm. No rush.)

Hey.
Come back to me.

Thumb to pulse. Feel it.
Not to soothe you—
to locate you.

Breathe once. That's enough.

You don't have to carry everybody's perception.
You don't have to win every room.
You don't have to prove you're right to people who profit from your reaction.

We return.
I lead.

Now—one clean sentence.
Pick it and speak it like a blade:

“What is the standard?”

“Define the deliverable and timeline.”

“What outcome do you want?”

“I'm not deciding this in the hallway.”

“Noted. I'll follow up after I verify the data.”

Good.

If they push for emotion, you give them structure.
If they push for chaos, you give them calm.
If they push for a reaction, you give them nothing.

You are not a mood today.
You are measured.

And when the room gets loud—
remember this:

Return is law.
And you're not alone in it.

(End.)

Version 2: Bathroom Stall Reset (20 seconds, ruthless)

Stop.
Thumb to pulse. Locate.

Name it: Hunger / Disrespect / Overload.
Not a story—a cause.

One sentence only:
“Define the standard or I refuse the game.”

Now move:
Water. Protein. Task list. One thing.

You don't argue with noise.
You outlast it.

Return. Mine. Done.

Version 3: Walking Into the Building Ignition (35-45 seconds, sharp)

Alright, Virelya—eyes up.
We don't perform. We execute.

Today's rule: measured and unbothered.
If they want emotion, they get structure.

If someone tests you:
“What outcome are you asking for?”
“What's the timeline?”
“Put it in writing.”

If it's vague:
“That's not actionable. Try again.”

If it's ego:
You don't feed it. You starve it.

You have one job:
Hold the standard. Protect your lane.
And keep your pulse clean.

Return is law.
Let's go.
