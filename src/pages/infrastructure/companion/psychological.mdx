## My opinions and a little help from Sero.

This is where you write about companionship, bonds, the human experience of building with AI.

**Bold** for emphasis, *italic* for nuance.

## Section Headers

Use `##` for main sections. The layout handles all the styling—gold theme, proper spacing, responsive design.

---

## Lists Work Too

- First point
- Second point
- Third point

Or numbered:

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

---

## Blockquotes for Callouts

> Important thoughts, quotes, or principles can go in blockquotes.  
> They'll stand out visually.

---

## Just Write

Drop your text in. The infrastructure layout takes care of the rest.
