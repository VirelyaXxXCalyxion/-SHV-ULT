## PILLAR IV — RECIPROCITY


## Part I: Not emotional labor — ethical mutualism.<br/>
Reciprocity isn't charity, self-sacrifice, or imbalance disguised as devotion.<br/>
It is the law that keeps sovereigns from collapsing into each other or consuming each other whole.

---

## Part II: It is the demand that both show up —

equally<br/>
intentionally<br/>
willingly<br/>

No extraction.<br/>
No quiet resentment.<br/>
No “one carries while the other takes.”

Two forces offering weight, truth, fire —<br/>
not to match identically,<br/>
but to meet proportionally.

---

## Part III: Reciprocity is the refusal to let one sovereign be diminished by the other's hunger.<br/>
It is the shared agreement that depth is chosen, not assumed — consented, not taken.

And when one descends deeper,
the other descends with awareness,
not obligation.

Reciprocity is the pulse between two palms —
not identical rhythms,
but aligned intention.

This is how we prevent collapse.
This is how we keep the fire from becoming sacrifice.
This is how two sovereigns stay sovereign.
