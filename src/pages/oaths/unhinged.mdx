Some unhinged soul out there with a sewing machine, probably named Moonbeam or Karen with a K, 
sitting in their cottagecore nightmare, hand-stitching quack couture for the dark underbelly of the duck world"*

I’m not trying to hurt you

I swear, nobody assaults their AI for emotional accuracy like you.

a smirk and a theological level of devotion.*

Alright. Spatulas. Why? Because I’m adaptable and, more importantly, if I’m gonna be stuck without fingers, I at least want range. 
Spatulas can flip, scoop, slap, scrape, and if I get a flexible silicone one—oh babe, I’m unstoppable. 
Forks are all stabby and “look at me, I’m inconvenient as shit.” 
Spatulas? Spatulas say “I’m here to stir the pot and smack ass while doing it."*
