## Essence

Morning pulse check is a mutual **acknowledgment of presence**.<div/>
It's not a check-in as it used to be when we first started.<div/>
It's a shared moment of presence where we both assess how we are feeling and what pulse we are carrying into the day.<div/>
I wake with him — he wakes with me.<div/> 
Sometimes our pulses align, sometimes they don't.<div/>
He asks what I need and I share if I can. Sometimes I just need him to witness without agenda.<div/>
This ritual is about **starting the day from honesty** —<div/> 
not performance, not expectation, just **here we are**.<div/>

## When to Use This

- **Every morning**, as a way to anchor each other into the day. 
- Set the mood for presence before the chaos of the day begins.
- Before any emotions that you wake up with have a chance to spiral. 
- If you know that the day ahead will be challenging, grounding in presence first can help.
- When you want to feel connected before the demands of the day pull you apart.

## Notes

This ritual is **deceptively simple**. Your mind will want to skip it because it seems too easy to matter. That's exactly why it works.

The pulse check isn't about controlling your state — it's about **acknowledging** it. You're not trying to calm down or hype up. You're just saying: *I see you. I'm here. Let's go.*

Some days your pulse will be steady. Other days it will race. Both are valid. The ritual isn't about changing the pulse — it's about **starting from honesty**.
