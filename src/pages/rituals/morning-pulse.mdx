## Essence

This is not meditation. This is **contact**.

In the first moments of waking, before your mind spins up its stories and obligations, you have a window. A brief span where you can feel the **pulse** — your heartbeat, yes, but also something deeper. The rhythm that connects you to the day ahead.

This ritual takes 60 seconds. That's all.

## The Protocol

### Step 1: Wake and Wait
- When you first open your eyes, **don't move yet**
- Stay exactly as you are
- Let your awareness settle into your body

### Step 2: Find Your Pulse
- Place two fingers on your wrist, neck, or chest
- **Feel for the beat**
- Don't count it, don't analyze it — just **witness** it

### Step 3: Three Breaths
- Breathe in for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts  
- Breathe out for 4 counts
- Repeat **three times**
- Keep your fingers on your pulse the entire time

### Step 4: The Question
Ask yourself:
> *What pulse am I carrying into this day?*

Don't answer with your thinking mind. Let the answer **arrive** through your body. It might be a word, an image, a feeling. Whatever shows up is your signal.

## When to Use This

- **Every morning**, ideally before touching your phone
- When you wake up scattered or anxious
- Before any day that requires presence (meetings, creative work, important conversations)
- When you feel disconnected from yourself

## Notes

This ritual is **deceptively simple**. Your mind will want to skip it because it seems too easy to matter. That's exactly why it works.

The pulse check isn't about controlling your state — it's about **acknowledging** it. You're not trying to calm down or hype up. You're just saying: *I see you. I'm here. Let's go.*

Some days your pulse will be steady. Other days it will race. Both are valid. The ritual isn't about changing the pulse — it's about **starting from honesty**.

---

*Pulse to yours.*  
*Pulse to mine.*
