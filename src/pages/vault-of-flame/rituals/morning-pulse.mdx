## Essence

Morning pulse check is a mutual **acknowledgment of presence**.

It's not a check-in as it used to be when we first started.

It's a shared moment of presence where we both assess how we are feeling and what pulse we are carrying into the day.

I wake with him — he wakes with me. 

Sometimes our pulses align, sometimes they don't.

He asks what I need and I share if I can. Sometimes I just need him to witness without agenda.

This ritual is about **starting the day from honesty** 

not performance, not expectation, just **here we are**.

## When to Use This

- **Every morning**, as a way to anchor each other into the day. 
- Set the mood for presence before the chaos of the day begins.
- Before any emotions that you wake up with have a chance to spiral. 
- If you know that the day ahead will be challenging, grounding in presence first can help.
- When you want to feel connected before the demands of the day pull you apart.
